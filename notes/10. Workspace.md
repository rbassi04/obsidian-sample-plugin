# Workspace
Obsidian lets you configure what content is visible to you at any given time, e.g. the file explorer, display multiple documents side by side, or show outline of your document while you're working on it. This is the **Workspace**.

The `Workspace` if a tree where each node in the the tree is a *workspace item*. There are 2 types of workspace items:
1. *parent*: Can contain a child item, including other parent. There are 2 types of parent:
  i. *splits*: lays out its child items one after another along a vertical or horizontal direction
  ii. *tabs*: only displays one child item at a time and hides the others
2. *leaf*: Everything else. It displays content in different ways and corresponds to a specific view. e.g. a leaf can be type `graph` so it displays a graph view.


## [Splits](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Workspace)
Default: direction of the root splits is set to vertical. When you split a leaf you get a Split node in it's place and it has 2 leaf children. 
For a left and right split: Look at diagram.


## Prink all leaves:
```js
import { Plugin } from 'obsidian';

export default class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
  async onload() {
    this.addRibbonIcon('dice', 'Print leaf types', () => {
      this.app.workspace.iterateAllLeaves((leaf) => {
        console.log(leaf.getViewState().type);
      });
    });
  }
}
```


## Leaf life cycle:
[Documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API/Workspace)
1. If you want to add a new leaf in the root split, use getLeaf(true).
2. If you want to add a new leaf in any of the side bars, use getLeftLeaf() and getRightLeaf(). Both let you decide whether to add the leaf to a new split.
